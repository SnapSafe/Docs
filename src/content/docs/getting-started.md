# Welcome

SnapSafe is a self-hostable photo sharing application designed from the ground up for privacy and security. Every photo is encrypted on your device before being uploaded to storage you own. Minimal personal data is stored in a database you also own. No prying eyes, no tracking, no data harvesting. You own and run everything.

# Technologies

SnapSafe is built using the following:

- [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)
